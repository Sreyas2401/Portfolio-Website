            <p>
                I&apos;m a junior majoring in Computer Science and Statistics at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. 
                I’m passionate about computer vision, machine learning, and software engineering. 
                Currently, I’m focused on understanding algorithms, learning advanced design principles to avoid monoliths, and diving deeper into advanced linear algebra.
